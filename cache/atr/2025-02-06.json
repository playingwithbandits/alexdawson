He still has low mileage overall for a horse of his age and, provided all is well following 20 months off, he could prove a tough nut to crack in his bid to make it 3-3 over the larger obstacles. Acey Milan gets the nod for forecast purposes, albeit only marginally as Angels Breath is also a very viable candidate for that role."
