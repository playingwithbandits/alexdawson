Ben Pauling's charge seemed to appreciate the step up in distance when staying on strongly over an extended 2m4f at Newbury recently, finishing second before being subsequently awarded the race.

Handstands actually beat him in the Sidney Banks last year and, after a inauspicious beginning to his chasing career, hasn't looked back with Grade 2 victories at Sandown and Ffos Las.
